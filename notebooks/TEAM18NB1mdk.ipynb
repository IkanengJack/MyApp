    "The effects of uninterrupted electricity supply for households and businesses cannot be overemphasized. As non-renewable energy sources become depleted, it is imperative for countries to reasonably transition into renewables. The government of Spain is considering an expansion of its renewable energy resource infrastructure investments. Thus, they require information on the trends and patterns of the countries renewable sources and fossil fuel energy generation. \n",

The app will provide accurate predictions that can help companies plan their resources and infrastructure accordingly.

    "- Telco companies have limited data-driven tools to support future fiber roll-out plans from a revenue perspective (e.g., HH uptake rates, competitive roll-outs,…)\n",
    "- Current SaaS solutions mainly focus on advanced cost calculations (Comsof, Netadmin, etc) but fail to support possible expansion areas from a ROI point of view\n",
    "- Project would consist in creating a tool which can predict revenue (based on HH uptake & competition) across geographies based on publicly available information, as granular as possible\n",
    "- The userface output would consist of a visual map showing most attractive fiber roll-out areas, including a dashboard showing the underlying unit economics for that area (revenue, costs, ROI)\n",
    "- The underlying scalable algorithm and database would be based on free open source data where we aim to identify unique commercial tenant's and households geospatially and provide meta data for each of these locations such as\n",
    "    - commercial vs residential.\n",
    "    - Multi dwelling unit vs single dwelling unit.\n",
